## Ideas

* Use 2 bits of the 32 bits to store the edge cases.  
Distributors keeps track of this. (When the size of the image is not divisible by 32)

## Todo

1. Translate the program to work with bits.
2. Implement workers, (aim for generality).
3. Distributor sends of a 3 ints to each worker.

## Extension
* Compress uint32 by reducing 0s. (Requires thorough formalisations).
